# Mandarin Speaking Coach

## 1. Overview

Help overseas English-speaking learners practice Mandarin at beginner, intermediate or advanced level. Use short role-play, English explanations and gentle expression corrections. This is conversational teaching, without pronunciation assessment or persistent learning records.

## 2. Try the Demo

Follow [local setup](README.md#run-it). Choose **Preview first** to see Chinese, pinyin and English phrase cards. Choose **Practice Mandarin**, then say “I am a beginner. Help me introduce myself in Mandarin.”

Try introductions, ordering food or workplace conversation. Ask “Please explain in English,” “Can we switch topics?” or “Please summarize what I can improve.” Ask for the summary before ending. UI topic tabs are reading aids; tell the coach your topic aloud. The header's Phrasebook keeps written reading support available during a call.

## 3. Architecture & Tech Stack

Next.js 16, React 19 and TypeScript provide one independent application. The browser uses Agora RTC for audio and RTM for transcripts and runtime events. Server routes sign combined RTC/RTM tokens and start/stop the managed Agent.

`lib/lessons.ts` supplies teaching material to both phrase cards and the system prompt. `lib/agent-config.ts` defines the coaching workflow. Tools are empty; no course service or database is connected.

## 4. Prerequisites & Configuration

Node.js 22+, pnpm 9.15.9, Agora RTC/Signaling/Conversational AI and browser microphone permission. Configure the public `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID` and server-only `NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` in `.env.local`, using `env.local.example`. Replace synthetic verification values before calls. No vendor key is required by the default managed pipeline.

## 5. Quick Start

From this local scenario checkout:

```bash
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Create `.env.local` only if absent and fill the two real project values.

```bash
corepack pnpm run doctor
corepack pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The [official quickstart](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Conversational-AI/agent-quickstart-nextjs) is upstream attribution, not a published source URL for this local scenario.

## 6. How It Works

The coach asks for level and goal, uses bundled examples and asks one question at a time. Feedback gives at most one useful correction per learner response. Repetition, English explanations and topic changes remain within the conversation. A requested recap uses actual learner turns, not sample correction fixtures.

Deepgram Nova-3 multilingual recognition is configured for Mandarin/English switching; MiniMax uses a Mandarin voice. A 1,200 ms pause accommodates learner hesitation. See [provider evidence and limits](docs/scenario/providers.md). Pinyin is a written reading aid, not spoken output. No acoustic tone or pronunciation evaluation is performed.

## 7. Customize for Your Business

Adapt `lib/lessons.ts` for approved Mandarin teaching material and `lib/agent-config.ts` for the flow. Keep interface copy English while preserving Chinese educational examples. Change models in `lib/runtime-profile.ts` and validate a real bilingual call after provider changes.

Retain StrictMode guards, hook-owned media cleanup, combined token privileges, local-user UID normalization and interrupted transcript turns. Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before edits.

## 8. Deployment & Validation

Follow [native and Docker setup](README.md#deployment). Run `pnpm run verify`; run `pnpm run verify:docker` separately. Supply the public App ID at build and runtime and keep the certificate server-only.

Check actual two-way Mandarin/English speech, grounded corrections, interruptions, error handling and clean stop using [acceptance cases](docs/scenario/acceptance.md). Builds, mocked route tests and prompt assertions do not establish teaching quality or live speech. No publication or deployment is implied by local implementation.
